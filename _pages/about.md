<div style="text-align: justify;">
I’m a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Milan](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) working full-time at the LEARN project and part-time in the EDULAB center. I obtained my PhD in sociology at the Department of Sociology at the University of Trento (UNITN)

My research primarily aims to understand what happens inside classrooms, focusing on the role of hierarchies, networks, and peer interactions in shaping students’ socio-emotional skills, academic achievement, educational choices, and health-related behaviors. In addition, I pursue a line of research examining how municipal-level public spending affects household outcomes, such as students’ academic performance and parents’ labor market outcomes. Methodologically, I rely on observational data drawn from administrative sources (e.g. INVALSI, INPS, municipal budgets), often exploiting quasi-experimental research designs.

My works have been published in *Social Science Research*, *Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies*, *European Societies*, and *Social Indicators Research*.

I am the Principal Investigator of the project “Child Penalties and Public Childcare Shortages under Fiscal Austerity”, funded by a VisitINPS fellowship. In the 2026–2027 biennium, I will serve as a member of the Early Career Reviewer Board of Social Science Research.
