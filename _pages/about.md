<div style="text-align: justify;">

<p>
I’m a postdoctoral researcher at the 
<a href="https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io">University of Milan</a>, 
working full-time on the <strong>LEARN</strong> project and part-time at the EDULAB Center. 
I obtained my PhD in Sociology from the Department of Sociology at the 
<strong>University of Trento (UNITN)</strong>.
</p>

<p>
My research primarily aims to understand what happens inside classrooms, focusing on the role of hierarchies, networks, and peer interactions in shaping students’ socio-emotional skills, academic achievement, educational choices, and health-related behaviors. In addition, I pursue a line of research examining how municipal-level public spending affects household outcomes, such as students’ academic performance and parents’ labor market outcomes. Methodologically, I rely on observational data drawn from administrative sources (e.g. INVALSI, INPS, municipal budgets), often exploiting quasi-experimental research designs.

My work has been published in 
<em>Social Science Research</em>, 
<em>Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies</em>, 
<em>European Societies</em>, 
and <em>Social Indicators Research</em>.

<p>
I am the Principal Investigator of the project 
“Child Penalties and Public Childcare Shortages under Fiscal Austerity”, 
funded by a VisitINPS fellowship. In the 2026–2027 biennium, I will serve as a member of the 
Early Career Reviewer Board of <em>Social Science Research</em>.
